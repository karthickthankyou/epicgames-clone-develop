However, as you progress, your small clan will expand and become known throughout the Upper Realms for their skill and premium craftsmanship.',

In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. You face the task of building the last city on Earth and securing the means necessary for your community to survive.',
      'THE CITY MUST SURVIVE',
      'Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.',
      'What decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And who will you become in the process?',
      'MAKE THE LAW',
      'Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.',
      'SHAPE YOUR SOCIETY',
      'If you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.',
      'WEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES',
      'Some of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.',
      'DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES',
      'Survival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships, and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.',
      'EXPLORE THE FROSTLAND',
      'While New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.',
      'PLAY ENDLESSLY',
      'Frostpunk Endless Mode grants you unlimited replayability for the game. Play on 8 various maps, with different terrain, weather conditions and challenges to face. We know that different people look for different experiences and that’s why there are 3 modes available. Endurance will be an ultimate test to your building, managing and survival skills in the harshest conditions. Builders, where there is no generator available from the start, which creates a different type of challenge.

The path you choose will profoundly change your experience and the way you look at the game's planets and resources.",
      'PLAY IT YOUR WAY',
      'The standard gameplay mode gives you 25 years to build the best empire you can, but there are others. The endless mode lets you play for as long as you can hold on to power, the sandbox mode allows you to experiment freely, while the ranked run is a chance to measure your skills against others around the world on pre-seeded maps.',
      'The game will also feature a campaign mode, with each scenario introducing a new twist and refreshing the gameplay: supernovae that have to be tamed or avoided, sectors with completely new resources to be mined, a dense nebula impeding your progress. On launch day, there will only be a few scenarios to explore, but their number will increase over time as free updates are released. The new mechanics introduced in the campaign will also feature in other modes, becoming new options for even more varied runs. ',

Now, Sonny is just a semi-alcoholic wreck of a bird on his paid leave, while Marty still hides behind the facade of a star-detective. During their last case, they nearly killed each other, and they haven't spoken ever since...",

      'A CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE',

The game was also heavily influenced by animated features like Porco Rosso, Fantastic Mr. Fox, and the series: BoJack Horseman.',

      'Procedural roguelite RPG in a vast world',
      'Unexplored 2 creates a vast, rich fantasy world for you to discover. It has a cool twist on permadeath: your character may die, but the world might persist. The game is an ambitious, procedural action-RPG without grind, xp, or gold. Instead the story is all about your choices and their consequences as history unfolds.',
      'As the titular Wayfarer you take on the quest to destroy the Staff of Yendor, for which you’ll have to traverse your world. Along the way you’ll meet tribes, encounter magical creatures and explore ancient ruins to discover mythical weapons and historic items.',
      'A word from our Game Director',
      '“Unexplored 2 is an Early Access game; it is not yet finished. The game is playable from start to finish, but you should expect more content to be added at a regular pace. New items, new enemies, new side quests, new variations on the main quests and even new game modes will arrive in themed packages. The procedural nature of the game makes it easy to slip in all the new content naturally. Every time you are ready to start a new world there will be new things for you to discover.”',
      '-- Joris Dormans, Game Director of Unexplored 2',
      'When you die…',
      'The game is challenging and you will die often. You may make a wrong choice, take on one too many creatures, or forget to stock up on food before traveling a desert. Whatever the reason, when your character dies, they’re gone. No autosaving or quickloading.',
      'However, you can choose to continue your adventures with a new character in the same world, a few years later. Your new character will witness the result of the choices your previous adventurer made. You can leave items in a safe spot, ready for your next Wayfarer to pick up and use.',
      'The world ends',
      'You can try to fulfill your quest to destroy the Staff of Yendor with consecutive Wayfarers in the same world. However, when you die during your final mission, your world ends. Permanently.',
      'So, make sure you are prepared well and know everything there is to know about the last and most dangerous part of your adventure.',
      'When you fail, that world vanishes. The only thing left to do is to generate a whole new world with its own history, and begin the quest anew.',
      'Key features',
      "Radical content generation: Ludomotion's radical approach to content generation creates many layers of unique content, every time a new world is generated.",
      "Generative storytelling: Though every Wayfarer's ultimate goal may be similar, every hero will have their own world, story, and encounters.",
      'Systemic depth: The game features many systems and you will discover something new every time you play, even after hundreds of hours of gameplay.',
      'Legacy system: Actions of your past heroes impact the fortunes of those that follow in their footsteps. Use your legacy wisely to give your successive adventurers greater hopes of completing their quest.',
      'Permadeath in a persistent world: When your hero dies, they stay dead. But you can choose to return to the same world with a new Wayfarer. Or, if you prefer, begin a new adventure in a completely unexplored world.',
      'Unique presentation: The worlds in Unexplored 2 are presented in a unique and beautiful art style, beyond what is conventionally expected from a generative game. A stylish lighting system sets the mood and adapts to the time of day and local weather conditions.',
      'Orchestral adaptive soundtrack: Your adventure is accompanied by an orchestral, original soundtrack which reacts to the action and decisions you make as a player.',

Your goal is to deal with small blows to the regime – dropping leaflets to spread awareness about what the Nazis are really up to among the people, painting messages on walls, sabotaging, gathering information and recruiting more followers. And all of that while staying undercover – if the regime’s forces learn about your group, the life of each member is in grave danger.',

      'Phoenix Point puts players in the midst of a desperate fight to take back the Earth from a mutating, alien menace. Featuring TurnBased tactical combat on procedurally generated maps, and resource management on a global scale, Phoenix Point offers endless replayability and a brutal challenge. ',
      'Following a global environmental disaster, the Pandoravirus appeared and began reshaping creatures, including humans, into hideous mutants. Unable to stop the progress of the virus, much of human civilization was wiped out -- only small enclaves remain, separated by their principles and the vast landscape. The Phoenix Project, an ancient failsafe against global catastrophe is the only hope to unite mankind and take back the planet. ',
      "Lead the Phoenix Project from its base at Phoenix Point. Research and develop new technologies and techniques, plan operations, build alliances to unite the planet-- or simply destroy your rivals. It's up to you to save the planet and rebuild civilization, but there may be much more to the alien threat than meets the eye. ",
      'Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced.',
      'Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Phoenix Point features a complex narrative, with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via multiple playthroughs. Discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself through exploration, diplomacy, and research.',
      'Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them.',
      "Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass. ",

      "A modern car factory is a near perfect example of efficiency, process-management and flow. A massive army of precision-controlled robots dance to a milimeter-perfect ballet of engineering excellence with perfect timing. Components snake along conveyor belts to a 'just-in-time' ordering system that leaves no pauses, no delay, or congestion. Nothing exists but the perfect flowing efficiency of high tech car construction...",
      '...in theory.',
      'In practice, of course, life is not so simple. When you get to grips with your first factory design, it certainly will not feel in a state of pure flow',
      'Making a handful of built-to-order cars and breaking even is one thing...but competing with the big multinationals and churning out thousands of cars for the mass market is a whole new ballgame.',
      'To win market share from the big companies you are going to need planning, an appreciation of future technology, a careful eye on your bottom line, and an ability to design a factory layout that makes use of every square meter, and cuts production costs per car to the absolute minimum. Have you got what it takes to win?',
      'Production line is the new car factory management/simulation/tycoon game from Positech Games, the developers of Democracy &amp; Gratuitous Space Battles, and publishers of Big Pharma. This game is designed to appeal to the efficiency geek in all of us, the person who cannot help but organize things for maximum performance. The closet entrepreneur, the stats-geek, Is that you? if so...welcome to your dream game (we hope!)',
      'The key to understanding production line is the division of labor and the merits of purpose-built machinery. At the start, your factory will be small and the individual slots on your production line will carry out large complex tasks (like fitting the car body). As you research better methods, and earn the funds to expand, you will continue to subdivide those slots into smaller (and faster) production areas which keep the flow of new vehicles flowing smoothly.',
      'At the same time, product design researchers will be working out how to enhance your cars with new technologies such as automatic headlights, power steering, bluetooth phone support and voice recognition.',

Their priority now is to find food, and there is plenty around; but there are other hungry creatures in the undergrowth. The workers will need to be vigilant.',
      'Game Description',
      'Empires of the Undergrowth is a real-time ant colony management game. You will excavate your nest underground, constructing tunnels and chambers to store food and raise brood. As the colony expands, you’ll send your intrepid ants on trails to explore the treacherous overworld and gather resources. Along the way your soldiers will need to outmass rival colonies and overwhelm other fearsome (but succulent) invertebrates including fast hunting tiger beetles, burrowing mole crickets, hidden mantids and huge whip spiders to name a few.',
      'Nature Theme &amp; Narrated Campaign',
      'The game tries to remain as close to nature as possible, with all of the ants and other creatures based upon real world counterparts (apart from a single genetic experiment outlier for gameplay purposes). The events that occur in the game reflect the true everyday struggles of these tiny insects, and should leave you with an added appreciation of the worlds that exist beneath your feet. The main story mode missions are narrated from the perspective of a documentary filmmaker studying the ants, who offers intelligent insight into the goings-on of the colony and the undergrowth beyond.',

      'Is this a solitaire game?',
      'Yes-ish. The Solitaire Conspiracy is inspired by a variant of solitaire called Streets and Alleys, but with some small adjustments and the big addition of suit based powers. Campaign and skirmish (choose your own suits and powers) are take-at-your-own-pace experiences that fit into your schedule. Countdown mode is a place to test your skills with nuanced powers against a ticking clock. ',
      'Are there microtransactions?',
      'Nope. We know we made a CardGame, and we know that there’s a risk you might think this game will charge you for unlocks, speed bonuses or aesthetics. We won’t. We may come up with a cool DLC at some point, and if so, will probably charge in the traditional way, but we won’t be charging you for double XP or a particularly shiny new colour theme.',

It works by controlling the “random” events that the world throws at you. Every thunderstorm, pirate raid, and traveling salesman is a card dealt into your story by the AI Storyteller. There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.',
      'Your colonists are not professional settlers',
      'Your colonists are crash-landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.',
      'Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play',
      'A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill – but he does that very well.',
      'Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships',
      "Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.",
      'The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator',
      'You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease-infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two-month growing season.',
      'Travel across the planet',
      "You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket-powered transport pods to travel faster.",
      'You can tame and train animals',
      'Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien-like lifeforms.',
      'People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment',
      "They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.",
      "Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities",
      "Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in-game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.",
      'You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent',
      "A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.",

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. The player can then decide to place one of his followers, so called Meeples, on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner. Each new game is a new experience thanks to the ever-changing landscape.',

Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.',

      'John Wick Hex',
      ' is a fast-paced, action-oriented strategy game that makes you think and strike like John Wick, the professional hitman of the critically acclaimed film franchise. Created in close cooperation with the creative teams behind the films, John Wick Hex is fight-choreographed chess brought to life as a video game, capturing the series’ signature gun fu style while expanding its story universe. Players must make quick decisions and choose every action and attack they make, all the while considering their immediate cost and consequences.',
      'Featuring a unique blend of strategic momentum-based combat, John Wick Hex captures the feel of the unique tactical combat from the films and blurs the line between the strategy and action video game genres. Perform well and progress in the main story mode (which features an original story created for the game) to unlock new weapons, suit options and locations. Each weapon changes up the tactics you’ll use and the manner in which you’ll play. Ammo is finite and realistically simulated, so time your reloads and make the most of weapons you scavenge on the job.',
      "Experience an original new story set prior to the events of the films which sees John on a desperate mission to rescue Winston and Charon from a dangerous new adversary seeking his birthright. This story is brought to life by the world class voice talents of Ian McShane and Lance Reddick, reprising their iconic roles from the films, and voice acting legend Troy Baker, joining the stellar cast as the game's eponymous villain 'Hex'. John Wick Hex compliments the style of the films with a unique graphic noir art design and an original score by renowned composer Austin Wintory.",

The more dangerously you drive, the faster you can go.  Bump, shunt, slam, scratch and scrape your way around 30 different courses set across seven different locations.  Takedown your opponent in the adrenaline fuelled Takedown Races, chain your way to perfection in Heatwave, or rule every road in Road Rage.&nbsp;",

      '“The present is theirs; the future is mine.” – Nikola Tesla',
      'It’s 1897. Deep in international waters, the Helios stands still. Dark clouds loom overhead as unforgiving waves crash against the hull. Colossal effigies of gold, decorated with magnificent finery, stretch as far as the eye can see.',
      'Born of Nikola Tesla’s vision, the Helios serves as a haven for the greatest scientific minds. An unbound utopia for research, independent from state and isolated from the gaze of society. Free to push the boundaries of matter and time.',
      'Journalist Rose Archer steps aboard the Helios in search of her sister Ada. She quickly discovers not all is as it seems. Grand halls stand empty. The stench of rotting flesh lingers in the air. Silence. A single word is painted across the entrance… QUARANTINE!',
